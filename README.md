# final-project

For this homework assignment, you will:

You must create a project named final-project
You must take this prototype  Download prototypeand convert it into a single page.  It is called Eventsy
It must look exactly like the prototype
You can find the fonts and images under the Files > Final - Eventsy folder. 
You must use jQuery or JavaScript
Use only one page and load all the content onto that page 
You must navigate using the routing that I show is class. This uses the URL for navigation.
Must use the MVC model we have discussed.
Upload your project to Github and Web4 and add your Web4 link to the README file in Github, and submit your Github link. 

Here is the link:

For whatever reason, when you change pages, the logo doesn't load automatically, but if you ctrl+shift+r, it will pop up. I don't know why that is, it must be something to do with the mvc.
